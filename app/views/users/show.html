  Display a user profile page.
  Don't worry about using actual user information.
  You can use fake user information (like "Bob Smith's profile")
  The important thing is that the page includes html headers and paragraphs
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a user.</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a blog.</h1>

    <p> This user does not have much to say. </p>
